**>>>Creepinson's Spigot Plugin Template for Complete Beginners<<< **
**Thank you for using my plugin template! It is free to use in any of your plugins, just please credit me. That's all I request.**
*This template includes an example command, and an example event listener.
*This template also includes a few utilities made both by me, and some other programmers out there.*

**If you want to add additional libraries to your plugin, just put them in the libs folder, and make sure to not delete any of the following libraries required! If they do need updating go ahead and replace the files just don't get rid of the required libraries.**
